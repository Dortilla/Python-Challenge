# Python-Challenge
### In this challenge, I was tasked with creating scripts to analyze two different data sets: **PyBank** & **PyPoll**

## **PyBank:**
### The PyBank script opens the file "budget_data.csv" and takes note of:
 - The total number of months in the dataset
 - The sum of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The changes of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of all of those changes
 - The greatest increase in profit (date and amount)
 - The greatest decrease in profit (date and amount)
### The script will then output a financial analysis in the terminal, and create a text file containing the same analysis in the 'Analysis' directory.

 ## **PyPoll:**
 ### The PyPoll script opens the file "election_data.csv", analyzes the votes and calculates: 
 - Total number of votes cast
 - List of candidates who recieved votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner, based on popular vote
### The script will then output an analysis of the election data, and create a text file containing this analysis in the 'Analysis' directory.
